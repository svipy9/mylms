Rule #1: A user may only register for a single instance of a course at any given time. This means that a user can't have multiple admissions to the same course.

Rule #2: Users are only permitted to register themselves for a course. They cannot create admissions for other users.

Rule #3: Once a user upgrades their course admission to a premium level, they will automatically be added to the course squad. This could be a specific group, cohort or class associated with that premium course.

Rule #4: Access to non-free lessons is exclusively provided to users with a premium admission. Users with basic or non-premium admissions will not have access to these lessons.

Rule #5: If a user has begun learning they forfeit the possibility to request a refund for their course fee.
